# cv_latex
My updated CV in latex. Used for IT industry and academia as well.
A very simple format. No fancy colours used. Neat format. Only plain black and white. Icons used which are part of standared latex distro, thus this code should compile on any modern latex distribution. I also use overleaf for the same. Github will also serve as sharing the PDF copies of the CV as well. So it serves an additional purpose as well. 
I intend to use this code repo for my IT industry CV and for Academia CV as well. For academia the number of pages used are very very long.
