\textbf{Design and Development of an Efficient H.264 Video Encoder for CPU/GPU using OpenCL} \hfill{7 months | September 2011 - March 2012}
    
      \begin{itemize}
          
        \item {In this Thesis an efficient H.264 video codec is developed using OpenCL for multicore architectures based on the x264 open source H.264 library}
        \item {The x264 library is profiled using sample videos on a CPU and performance hotspots are identified for optimisation. These hotspots are optimized by means of encapsulation into the OpenCL kernel loops where 4 parallel threads are created by OpenMP. Further, compiler optimization flags and assembly instructions within the x264 library are used to improve memory efficiency and execution speed}
        \item {\underline {\textbf{Tools used}: C, grpof, x264, H.264, Assembly, OpenCL, x86, Ubuntu Linux}}

   \textbf{Design and Implementation of On-board Moving Target Detection, Tracking and Navigation}\hfill {6 months | December 2010 â€“ May 2011}

      \begin{itemize}
        \item {The objective of this project is to detect objects using computer vision techniques in real time. The project consists of two entities, an on board Image processing module and a Robot navigation module}
        \item {The algorithm used is Optic flow based Horn Shaunk algorithm. The application is written in OpenCV and cross compiled for ARM architecture}
        \item {\underline{\textbf{Tools used}: Leopard board (TI OMAP ARM), OpenCV, x86, UniBoard, AVR, Ubuntu Linux}}
